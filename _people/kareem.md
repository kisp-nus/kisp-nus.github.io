Hi, I'm Kareem! I'm passionate about the discovery, synthesis, and
dissemination of knowledge. I'm always learning, whether in my core
research on cryptography, learning languages, or dog training. I'm
currently pursuing a PhD under [Prateek
Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/) at KISP, with a focus on
applied cryptography and theoretical computer science. I aim to make
the world, or at least the internet, a better and more private place
by building cryptographic tools that are more practical than what we
had before.

In addition to research, I also love teaching and sharing knowledge.
I've recently been awarded the NUS School of Computing Teaching
Fellowship for excellence in teaching, and was a Teaching Assistant
to [Prashan
Vasudevan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prashant/research.html) for
[CS4230/5430 Foundations of Modern
Cryptography](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prashant/teaching/CS5430/).
