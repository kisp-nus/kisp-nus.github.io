Our research directions are summarized in the following themes.

For more information about our work, please visit our [projects](/#projects), and [recent publications](#publications).

### Theme 1: Blah Blah Systems

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed do
eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
ad minim veniam, quis nostrud [exercitation ullamco](#)
laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure
dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu
fugiat nulla pariatur. We have also developed [some fancy
stuff](#) and [other things](#) that do amazing things.
Finally, we created [groundbreaking innovations](#) in
this field.

Our ultimate goal is to revolutionize how people think about
computing by creating tools that may or may not work but sound
really impressive in grant proposals.

### Theme 2: Making Computers Do Things

We make computers do things automatically so humans don't have to.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Our recent breakthroughs
include making [fancy tool 1](#) and [fancy
tool 2](#) which supposedly do something useful. We've also created
[another tool](#) that might change the world, or at
least that's what we claimed in the paper.

Our long-term vision involves creating skynet, but we tell funding
agencies we're working on beneficial AI tools.

### Theme 3: Complex Stuff That Sounds Important

This research area has been around since the dinosaurs roamed the
Earth, but we're still finding new ways to make it complicated. We've
developed [theoretical frameworks](#) that nobody
understands and [practical tools](#) that sometimes work.
Our contributions include [impressive-sounding tool](#)
and [another breakthrough](#) that we're pretty sure does
something useful. We've also applied our expertise to make
[existing systems](#) slightly less terrible.

Our mission is to make this field so complex that only we can
understand it, ensuring job security for generations to come.
