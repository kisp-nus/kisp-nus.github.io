In general, compared with hardware, software is complex, buggy and easy to compromise.
The recent surge in public interests in trusted execution environments (TEEs)
and confidential computing has recognised this issue, and reducing the software TCB
has been a pressing need in various contexts ranging from cloud services to edge devices.
Prior work has attempted to extend existing virtual-memory-based architectures for such
a goal.
In CAPSTONE, we seek to provide a more principled capability-based approach.
