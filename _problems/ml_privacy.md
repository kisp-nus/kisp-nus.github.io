There are more examples of principled approaches to analyzing machine learning
security in our work. We applied [quantitative verification](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/papers/Provero-icse21.pdf) 
for fairness and adversarial robustness for neural networks. 
We have analyzed when membership inference tests are conclusive. 
[Our work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.08615) shows the importance of causal reasoning here, as opposed to drawing conclusions purely with observations of statistical correlation. We have worked on making differential privacy more practical for
fully-distributed graph processing, e.g. for [hierarchical clustering](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/papers/Privact.pdf) and [training GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03105). Lastly, we
are studying [data repudiation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576915.3623093), i.e., convincing a verifier that a data point was not used in training.
