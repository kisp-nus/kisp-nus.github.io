Capability-based systems are very different from the ubiquitous virtual-memory-based systems,
and a naive design either compromises the strengths of capabilities, or requires
extensive changes in software.
We aim to design a capability-based system that interoperates well with existing software stacks while
maintaining the advantages of capabilities.
