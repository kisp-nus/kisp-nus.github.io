Security of machine learning (ML) systems is a relatively new topic in computer security with many concerns highlighted in the last decade through attack procedures and defenses.
However, fundamental questions in this space such as distinguishing between the intended vs. unintended (malicious) behavior or developing algorithms to test and verify desirable properties with guarantees remain open.
This is because, among others, ML models are learned through complex stochastic procedures from data coming from an unknown distribution, we often do not have ground truth of what they should be learning, and it is difficult to perfectly capture the highly non-linear and high-dimensional internals of the models.
On top of all this, the adversaries can be adaptive or employ their own ML strategies.

It is thus imperative to analyze security in a *systematic* way when considering machine learning systems in *practical* setups.

At a technical level, we work on three directions: ML privacy, ML Robustness, and ML Applications.
